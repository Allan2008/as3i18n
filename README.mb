as3i18n
=============

Flexible localization library to handle localization of your ActionScript 3 projects.
It features a highly customizable api that does not tie you to any specific implementation or format.

The library defaults to use XML to store the localized strings, a simple XML loader, and data parser.

It has been used with different source formats such as simple key par in TXT file or gettext po files.
Examples of such use are not included at the moment.

Exaples and Documentation
-------------------------

At the moment there is only one simple flash AS3 example to get you started.
Next goal will be to create some wiki pages and decent examples as well as some
more advanced ones to showcase the flexibility and power of the library.
